Subject: Request for Deferment of Loan Payments

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a deferred payment of my outstanding loan from [Bank/Financial Institution] for the term of [Loan Term]. I understand that this is an important step in managing my finances and ensuring timely repayment of the loan.

As per my current circumstances, I have been facing unforeseen expenses that require immediate attention. Due to these challenges, I need to delay making certain payments until such time when they can be handled more efficiently. This will allow me to focus on other aspects of my life while avoiding any further debt accumulation.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could consider granting me a temporary grace period during which I will continue to make all necessary payments. This will help me avoid defaulting on the loan and ensure that I am able to repay it fully within the terms of the agreement.

Please let me know how we can proceed with this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
